# Edu-AI

Edu-AI is a web-application / service that provides educational / learning support / AI-driven assistance for learners.  
It aims to make learning more accessible and interactive by using AI and web technologies.

## Features

- Web-based application (Python backend + HTML/JS/CSS frontend) — easy to deploy and use in a browser or local server.  
- Simple, clean folder structure: contains `app/`, `templates/`, `run.py`, and `requirements.txt`.  
- Uses Python (plus web-stack) to implement its functionality.  
- Flexible — can be extended to add more learning/training modules, content, or AI features as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (backend and logic)  
- **HTML / JavaScript / CSS** (frontend / templates)  
- Typical web dependencies (as per `requirements.txt`)  
- (Optionally) AI / ML libraries — for future expansion  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed (recommended: Python 3.x)  
- `pip` for installing dependencies

Open Source & Collaboratable — straightforward codebase to invite contributions, improvements or adaptations.

### How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:

Add new learning modules or resources

Improve frontend UI/UX (templates, styling, responsiveness)

Integrate AI / ML features (e.g. recommendation engine, interactive tutor, content personalization)

Improve documentation, add tests, or add deployment scripts

If you add substantial functionality, updates or breaking changes — please include a clear description and usage instructions.
